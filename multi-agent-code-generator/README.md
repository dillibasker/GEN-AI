## Multi-Agent Code Generation System

This project demonstrates a Gen-AI based code generation system
using LangChain and Google Gemini Flash.

### Agents:
1. Planning Agent – analyzes requirements
2. Designing Agent – designs system structure
3. Creating Agent – generates source code
4. Testing Agent – validates the generated code

### Advantages:
- Modular AI reasoning
- Higher code accuracy
- Reduced hallucination
- Real-world Gen-AI workflow
